                My name is Marcelo Sanchez, I know I already gave an intro of myself. So this can be a continuacion of
                the story of my life. To make this short and frank, I worked many hours in many companies for lots of
                hours, days, weeks, months, years(I'm sure you get the jist). Suddenly I came to the realization, after
                speaking with some close successful programmer friends, that I needed to work somewhere that i could be
                appreciated after putting in the time and knowledge.

                All of this is not only for money or the attraction to the craft, but I have 2 little eyes watching my
                every move. I know the desicions I make, now, govern the future of (not only me) my family. Bottom line
                is that finally me and my family have everything to look forward to because of this step that I'am
                unregrettably taking.
